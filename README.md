# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The project consisted of finding weather and hotels at random or criteria-based cities.  The weather was explored for various locations by assembling urls and making requests across the internet.  The weather was saved as a csv file which was used in shaping the projects for hotel searches and for a directional map for a planned vacation.  Some features exercised in this project were:
- importing necessary modules
- assembling a request url
- looping through search results to make a dataframe
- understanding the returned results of the search for customized dataframes
- obtaining the necessary information from the dataframes for grahing 
- performing linear regression
- mapping with heat_layers and direction_layers
